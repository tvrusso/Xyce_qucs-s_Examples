## Demo of S parameter extraction

This very embryonic demo shows off Qucs-s support for Xyce S parameter
simulation and plotting using Smith diagrams.

This example will only work in versions of Qucs-s *after* release
0.0.23 (at this time, only available by compiling the "current" branch
from source out of git).
