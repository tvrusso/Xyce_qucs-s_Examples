# Some demo circuits for Qucs-s and Xyce

This repo holds a few schematics I've created for demonstrating Qucs-S
usage with Xyce.  Xyce has no schematic capture capability, so qucs-s
can really benefit Xyce users.

# Why this repo exists

When Qucs-s gained the ability to work with Xyce, the Xyce team
briefly considered adopting it as our official GUI and contributing to
its development.

I developed a series of examples on how to use Xyce and Qucs-s
together, largely based on examples I had previously used when trying
to get people excited about using Xyce and gEDA together (an effort
that failed).

Sandia management nixed the plan to adopt Qucs-s and so the effort was
shelved.

I, however, continue to dabble with Qucs-s for my personal work and so
I created a personal repository (not affiliated with or approved by
Sandia) of my examples, and I try to keep them up to date as Qucs-s
development continues.

# How to contribute

If you find issues with these examples and have suggested fixes,
please submit pull requests, which are far easier to work with than
just about any other method.  I do not have a lot of time to work on
this, as it is orthogonal to my day job.
